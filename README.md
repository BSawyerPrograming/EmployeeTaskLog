# EmployeeTaskLog
## My Goal
This is a personal project to help me learn and familiarize myself with C#, Entity Framework, and database management as well as any additional topics that are relevant

## The Project
The project is relatively simple. I am using Entity Framework and C# to interact with a SQL server. It will:
  *Create tables in the database
  *Add data to the table
  *Adjust data values based on current data
  *Read out data to users
  *Assign tasks to employees
  
It's built around a employee logging system that will log tools and tasks that can be assign to the employee. It should also Flag if all tools are in use already. Employees will be able to check in and out tools through the system which will toggle the InUse Boolean value. Employees can be assigned to a job through the system.

## Posible Future Features
Future note: perhaps can add a client class/table to represent a client that can order a job to be completed to simulate a contracting or freelancing company model.
